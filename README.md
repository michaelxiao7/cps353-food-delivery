# cps353-food-delivery
A react app that allows people to place food orders through a form

This is an app that will feature a colorful page that first displays a textbox, some kind of a time input box, and a textbox that autofills
1) The textbox will ask users to fill in their name
2) The time input box will prompt users to fill in a time that they want their food to arrive
3) The autofilling textbox will prompt autofills (in grey text in the background) for various dorm names that begin with the text that the user has already typed in

After hitting submit, an email confirmation will be sent to the user, which will allow them to track the order in real time (this may be a static web page if it's way too difficult to implement in such a short amount of time)
